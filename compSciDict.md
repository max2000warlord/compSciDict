### Binary Search

A binary search function has four parameters in its function signature (method signature in java):

- The list, often initialised as **lst**.
- The search parameter, which is referred to as the **key**.
- The low end of the search range, often called something like **low**, **start**, or **floor**
- The high end of the search range, often called **high**, **end**, or **ceiling**.

## Programming

### Components

#### Linker

A program which takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable or library. It also assigns final memory addresses to code and data sections. This is important, because compilers often generate object files with relative or undefined addresses.

##### Static

Produces an executable with all required code inside the executable, such as "gcc -o program main.o lib.a"

##### Dynamic

Loads shared libraries at runtime. Smaller executable size, and allows for updating without having to compile the executable every time.

> :note: **Examples:**
> Linux: lib.so files
> Windows: .dll files

### Tools

#### Linter

A static code analyser, sort of like a spell-checker for code.
