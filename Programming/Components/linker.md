# Linker

A program which takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable or library. It also assigns final memory addresses to code and data sections. This is important, because compilers often generate object files with relative or undefined addresses.

## Static

Produces an executable with all required code inside the executable, such as

```C
gcc -o program main.o lib.a
```

## Dynamic

Loads shared libraries at runtime. Smaller executable size, and allows for updating without having to compile the executable every time.

> :note: **Examples:**
> : lib.so files
> : .dll files
