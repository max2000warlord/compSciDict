### Binary Search

A binary search function has four parameters in its function signature (method signature in Java):

- The list, often initialised as **lst**.
- The search parameter, which is referred to as the **key**.
- The low end of the search range, often called something like **low**, **start**, or **floor**.
- The high end of the search range, often called **high**, **end**, or **ceiling**.
